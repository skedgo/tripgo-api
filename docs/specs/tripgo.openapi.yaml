  description: "The TripGo API allows you to plan door-to-door trips using a large\
    \ variety of public and private transport. It integrates real-time information\
    \ and, for selected providers, allows users to book and pay for transport.<br/>\
    \ <br/> This API is optimised to return a large number of trip results while maintaining\
    \ a small package sizes. This has a number of complications. Notably, to get a\
    \ trip's segments you need to combine the segment references with the segment\
    \ templates."

      summary: All-day routing between events
      description: |
        Calculates itinieraries for a complete time period considering
        between a sequence of calendar events and habitual events (such
        as home, work, or a hotel stay). Considers having to park and
        return vehicles, and handles clashes caused by overlapping events
        or evens that are too close in time but too far in location.

        Also allows to
        - specify which event should get preference in case of a clash (by
          setting the priority of the event input items)
        - fix a trip between two events (by providing it in the input
          sequence)
        - provide a list of preferred trip patterns between locations (by
          providing it in the optional `patterns` parameter), e.g., "when
          going from home to work, prefer taking train station X".

      description: |
        Calculates itinieraries for a complete time period considering
        between a sequence of calendar events and background events (such
        as home, work, or a hotel stay). Considers having to park and
        return vehicles, and handles clashes caused by overlapping events
        or evens that are too close in time but too far in location.

        Also allows to
        - specify which event should get preference in case of a clash (by
          setting the priority of the event input items)
        - fix a trip between two events (by providing it in the input
          sequence)
        - provide a list of preferred trip patterns between locations (by
          providing it in the optional `patterns` parameter), e.g., "when
          going from home to work, prefer taking train station X".
        - limit the resulting trips to certain modes (by specifying the
          optional `modes` parameter)

      summary: Create travelling tourist problem
      description: |
        Creates a new instance of a travelling tourist problem (which is a variant of the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)). The problem is defined as follows: Given both a sorted list `A` and set `B` of locations, insert the locations from the set `B` into `A` in the optimal order somewhere after `A`'s first and before `A`'s last element, while keeping all the elements of `A` in their same relative order. Solutions will also include information on how to travel from one location to the next.

        In the input, `insertInto` is that list `A` and requires at least two elements defining the start and end, and `insert` is the set `B`.

        Note: `B` can be empty, in which case this behaves very similar to `waypoint.json` but rather than returning a single trip that goes via the waypoints you get alternatives for going from one location to the next.

        This servlet does not return the solution, but instead returns an ID which you can use to fetch the solution.

      summary: POIs for map region (using cell IDs)

        This variant using cell IDs is recommended if the client wants to cache locations locally, while frequently calling this endpoint to make sure the local data is update without requiring a lot of data overhead (and having most of the logic on the server).

      summary: Departure timetable for a stop
      description: |
        Gets the departure timetable for a provided list of transit stops. It returns the next `limit` departures after `timeStamp` across any of the provided `embarkationStops`. If multiple stops are provided, the returned services might therefore only cover a subset of the provided stops.

        If `disembarkationStops` is provided, then the returned timetable covers only services between any of the embarkation stops and any of the disembarkation stops. If the region of the embarkation stops and the region of the disembarkations stops is not the same, then you must specify the `disembarkationRegion` of the `disembarkationStops`.

        Note that the the stop codes in the embarkation stops might *not* match the stop codes provided in the input. This happens if the input specified the stop code of a "parent" station (e.g., a major train station) but all the departures are from one of the parent station's "children" (e.g., a platform of that train station). If that's the case, then the `parentInfo` array will provide additional information on the parent station and its children.

        Details of the specific route that a service takes.
        Which stops are included in the `stops` list depends on the `travelled` status of the shape. For travelled shapes, all stops including embarkation and disembarkation are included. Non-travelled shapes however exclude the embarkation and disembarkation (as those would have been part of the travelled shape already).
        If there's a train from A to H and the travelled part is C to F, which changes its service identifier at E, we end up with 4 shapes. 1) non-travelled with `A+B`, 2) travelled with `C+D`, 3) travelled with `E+F`, 4) non-travelled with `G+H`.
