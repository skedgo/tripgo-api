Right after signing up, the API will serve results for regions and transport providers that publish their data as Open Data and which have already been connected to our system.

The TripGo API can be extended in the following ways:

1. Unlock transport modes, regions and real-time data from services that require you to first accept their terms or acquire API credentials.
2. Add new transport modes through our TSP Connectors.
3. Add new regions through our Region Connectors (coming soon).

To get real-time data for providers who aren't using Open Data, follow the instructions for the provider below. If you want to use a provider that hasn't yet been connected to our system, please get in touch with our team [by mail](mailto:api@skedgo.com) or on [Slack](http://slack.tripgo.com/) (by [self-invite](http://slackin.tripgo.com/)).

## Adding new providers: TSP connectors

For TSPs that are not yet integrated into our platform, you can add them by:
 
1. Implementing the corresponding API according to our [API specs](https://skedgo.github.io/TSP-APIs/), and then
2. Sending the URL of where you have deployed your implementation to [api@skedgo.com](mailto:api@skedgo.com).
 
The process then involves a manual step (which we plan to automate) to add that to our list of TSP connectors and enable it.
It will usually take 1 day after it is added to our list for results will then include the new TSP, with some exceptions like pod based share vehicles, which will take between 3 and 7 days. 

### How does this work

All TSP connector APIs [share](https://skedgo.github.io/TSP-APIs/shared) in common three endpoints:

- **config**: the list of endpoints that are implemented, similar to [gbfs.json](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/v2.0/gbfs.md#gbfsjson)  
- **provider**: the information about the provider, which may include links to mobile apps and deep links (with a pattern); and also the list of modes for the TSP 
- **coverage**: a list of coverage areas of the provider, and for each area, it is possible to define available products and pricing rules    

Config endpoint allows our platform to understand what are the capabilities of the TSP integration of each connector.
Provider information is what our platform will use to attribute results. This will be passed on with any API responses that include results from your TSP connector.
Coverage will allow our platform to know in which areas (i.e., regions) the TSP will be enabled.


### Taxi and TNC

For taxi and TNC providers we defined a [Taxi](https://skedgo.github.io/TSP-APIs/taxi/) API which allows you to:

- Add static pricing (in `coverage` endpoint), which will be shown as an estimate cost and used by our routing engine when creating trip alternatives.
- Provide real-time ETAs, which might differ by "product".
- Provide real-time costs estimations based on specific trip details.
- Enable in-app booking capabilities, so users can directly initiate the booking process through our platform.


### Shared bikes, scooters and cars

For shared vehicles, such as bikes, scooters or cars, we support the GBFS standard with the addition of the shared endpoints mentioned above (except for `config` which is replaced by the standard `gbfs.json`). This includes support for car-sharing, but be aware that this part of the standard is not finalised yet (as of February 2021).
We also support GBFS sources with only one endpoint, for example just the [free_bike_status.json](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/v2.0/gbfs.md#free_bike_statusjson) endpoint.

## Adding "info" data sources

Similar to TSP connectors above, you can create a "info" connector to enhance our platform with more information, as defined in the [Info](https://skedgo.github.io/TSP-APIs/info/) API, which allows:
 
 - Reporting real-time events on a given location or area. The model follows GTFS-R standard and will be added to our platform responses accordingly.
 - Integrating bike lanes, which will be used by our cycling results to prioritise those paths.
